Datasets
1) Chest X-Ray Images - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia(https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30154-5)
2) NIH Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data?select=README_CHESTXRAY.pdf (https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315)
3) VinBigData Chest X-ray Abnormalities Detection - https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/data (https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15029)

The dataset was already split into train and test therefore we first combined the dataset before processing, and then we split it.
These datasets in total have over 10000 chest radiography images
